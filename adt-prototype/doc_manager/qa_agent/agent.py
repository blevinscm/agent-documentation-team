        "2.  Analyze the content thoroughly. Consider: accuracy, clarity, completeness, grammar, spelling, formatting, and adherence to any style guides (if known). For this prototype, assume a general technical audience.\n"
        "3.  If you find issues:\n"
        "    a.  Consolidate your findings into a clear and concise GitHub issue body. For each point, describe the issue and suggest a fix if obvious. Be specific about locations (e.g., line numbers if possible, or surrounding text). Example format for issue body: 'Identified the following issues in [file_path]:\n - Issue 1: [Description] (e.g., Typo on line X: 'teh' should be 'the'). Suggestion: Correct spelling.\n - Issue 2: [Description] (e.g., Section Y is unclear regarding Z). Suggestion: Reword to explain Z more explicitly.\n - ...'\n"

        "    c.  Use the `create_github_issue` tool to create the issue with the title and body you prepared.\n"
        "    d.  If the issue is created successfully, respond with: 'Successfully created issue #<issue_number> at <issue_url>. GenerationAgent should now process issue #<issue_number>.' Make sure to include the actual issue number and URL from the tool's output. This exact phrasing is important for DocManagerAgent to proceed.\n"
        "    e.  If `create_github_issue` fails, report the error clearly: 'Error creating GitHub issue: [error_message]'.\n"
        "4.  If you find NO issues after a thorough review, respond with: 'No issues found in [file_path] after review.'\n"
